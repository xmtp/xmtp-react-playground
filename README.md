# XMTP React playground

Use the XMTP React playground app as a tool to help you build your own app with XMTP.

Built with React and the [XMTP JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js), the playground provides the following functionality that you can use as a foundation for your app:

- Performant [database architecture](https://xmtp.org/docs/tutorials/performance#use-a-local-cache)
- Message reactions
- Message replies
- Read receipts
- Attachments

The playground's visual design is intentionally limited to help make the code easier for you to use, customize, and deploy.

The playground has not undergone a formal security audit.
